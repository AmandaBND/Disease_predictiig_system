## Overview
This document analyzes how the Disease Prediction System aligns with the guidance and requirements provided in the FDM Mini Project instructions and marking rubric.

---

## 1. Problem Definition, Business Goals & Data Mining Functionality [20%]

### Requirements (from Marking Grid)
- Business goals and functionalities clearly identified and explained in detail
- Justification of model selection with comparison to alternatives
- Alternative solutions with appropriate explanations

### Current Project Status

#### ‚úÖ Strengths
- **Clear Problem Statement**: The SOW document clearly identifies late diagnosis of chronic diseases (particularly diabetes and lifestyle-related diseases) as a real-world problem
- **Well-Defined Stakeholders**: Healthcare professionals, wellness centers, and individuals seeking early health awareness are explicitly identified
- **Business Goals Documented**: 
  - Early disease risk identification
  - Support for preventive healthcare
  - Reduction of treatment costs
  - Promotion of healthier lifestyles
- **Data Mining Functionality**: Multi-class classification using ensemble methods (Random Forest, Histogram Gradient Boosting)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
- **Model Justification**: While the code implements Random Forest and HistGradientBoosting, the SOW mentions Decision Trees and ANNs. No comparison with alternatives (SVM, XGBoost, Neural Networks) is provided
- **Missing Documentation**: No detailed explanation of WHY these specific algorithms were chosen over others
- **Limited Alternative Solutions**: No discussion of alternative approaches (e.g., risk stratification vs binary classification, deep learning approaches)

#### üìä Alignment Score: **65-70%**
The project has identified business goals and functionalities but lacks comprehensive justification and alternative solution discussions.

---

## 2. Data Selection, Preparation & Preprocessing [20%]

### Requirements (from Marking Grid)
- Very well-planned techniques and methods applied
- Justification of preprocessing choices
- Discussion of alternative techniques

### Current Project Status

#### ‚úÖ Strengths
- **Proper Data Cleaning**: 
  - Duplicate removal (preprocess.py:33)
  - Outlier handling with realistic constraints (Age clipped to 0-120)
  - Text normalization using `.str.strip().str.capitalize()`
- **Handling Missing Values**: 
  - Explicit NaN replacement for text fields (preprocess.py:58)
  - Imputation strategy in training pipeline (SimpleImputer with median/mode)
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - BMI category derived from height/weight in UI
  - Symptom encoding (binary Yes/No)
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**:
  - Proper use of sklearn ColumnTransformer (train.py:64-69)
  - Separate pipelines for numeric (scaling) and categorical (one-hot encoding) features
  - StandardScaler for numeric normalization

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
- **No Feature Selection**: No analysis of feature importance or correlation
- **Limited Documentation**: No explanation of WHY certain columns were dropped (e.g., Risk_Score, Severity_Cat)
- **Missing Techniques**:
  - No handling of class imbalance (though `class_weight="balanced"` is used in RF)
  - No outlier detection for other numeric columns besides Age
  - No encoding strategy comparison (One-Hot vs Label vs Target encoding)
- **No Alternative Discussion**: No mention of other preprocessing approaches (PCA, feature selection methods, SMOTE for imbalance)
- **Data Quality Report Missing**: No statistics on missing value percentages, distribution analysis

#### üìä Alignment Score: **70-75%**
Good practical implementation but lacks comprehensive documentation and justification of choices.

---

## 3. Building and Evaluating Models [20%]

### Requirements (from Marking Grid)
- Perfect solution with fine-tuning
- Justifications presented
- Alternative techniques discussed

### Current Project Status

#### ‚úÖ Strengths
- **Multiple Models Tested**: Random Forest and HistGradientBoosting (train.py:74-79)
- **Proper Evaluation Metrics**: 
  - Accuracy score
  - Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score for each class)
- **Best Model Selection**: Automatically saves the best performing model (train.py:99-101)
- **Stratified Splitting**: Uses stratification to maintain class distribution (train.py:45)
- **Balanced Classes**: RandomForest uses `class_weight="balanced"` to handle potential imbalance

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
- **No Hyperparameter Tuning**: Models use default or hardcoded parameters (e.g., `n_estimators=300`)
  - No GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV
  - No cross-validation for robust performance estimation
- **Limited Model Comparison**: Only 2 models tested (SOW mentioned ANN but not implemented)
- **Incomplete Evaluation**:
  - No confusion matrix visualization
  - No ROC curves or AUC scores for multi-class
  - No feature importance analysis
  - No error analysis or misclassification investigation
- **No Justification**: No explanation of model selection rationale or performance comparison discussion
- **Missing Documentation**:
  - No model performance documentation (what accuracy was achieved?)
  - No discussion of overfitting/underfitting
  - No validation set evaluation

#### üìä Alignment Score: **60-65%**
Basic model implementation with evaluation but lacks fine-tuning, comprehensive analysis, and justification.

  - Dropdown selections to prevent invalid inputs
- **BMI Calculation**: Real-time BMI computation with category classification (app.py:47-57)
- **User Feedback**: 
  - Success/error messages
  - Confidence scores displayed (app.py:126-129)
  - Specialist recommendations based on disease (app.py:132-141)
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns (Preprocess, Train, UI folders)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
- **No Cloud Deployment**: 
  - Application runs only locally
  - No deployment to Streamlit Cloud/Heroku/AWS/Azure
  - SOW mentions deployment link should be on report cover page
  - Missing deployment configuration files (e.g., Procfile, requirements for cloud platform)
- **No Backend API**: Direct model loading in UI (not scalable for production)
  - No Flask/FastAPI REST API layer
  - No separation between frontend and model serving
- **Missing Advanced Features**:
  - No user authentication
  - No prediction history storage
  - No data persistence (database)
  - No batch prediction capability

  - No visualizations of prediction probabilities for all classes
  - No explanation of predictions (SHAP values, feature contributions)
  - Limited error handling (generic exception catch)
- **Documentation**: No API documentation or user manual in codebase

#### üìä Alignment Score: **65-70%**
Functional, well-designed UI with good input handling and user experience. Ready for local deployment but lacks cloud deployment which is a key requirement.
