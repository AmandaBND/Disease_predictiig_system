  across different screen sizes
- Added comprehensive custom CSS styling with gradient backgrounds, creating a 
  modern, professional medical application aesthetic
- Introduced color-coded BMI category indicators with distinct styling classes 
  (bmi-normal, bmi-underweight, bmi-overweight, bmi-obese) for immediate visual 
  feedback
- Applied gradient color schemes consistently across all UI cards (prediction, 
  success, info) with shadows for depth and visual hierarchy

Component Organization and Layout:
- Restructured input fields into logical sections with custom section headers 
  for improved information architecture
- Implemented multi-column layouts using st.columns() for compact, organized 
  presentation of related inputs
- Grouped demographics (age, gender, ethnicity) in a 3-column layout for 
  efficient space usage
- Organized lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, diet, activity) in a 4-column 
  grid layout
- Created collapsible expander for optional medical history fields to reduce 
  visual clutter
- Separated physical measurements (height, weight) into 2-column layout with 
  real-time BMI calculation display

Enhanced User Feedback and Interaction:
- Added spinner animation with "Analyzing patient data..." message during 
  prediction processing to indicate system activity

  light blue tones matching medical theme)
- Styled all input labels with enhanced font weight and size for improved form 
  accessibility
- Added shadow effects to cards and buttons for modern, elevated design 
  appearance
- Ensured text contrast meets accessibility standards with dark text on light 
  backgrounds

GITIGNORE UPDATES (.gitignore):

Added comprehensive exclusions for temporary project files and documentation:
- diff_output.txt, commit_message.txt (temporary git operation files)
- AGENTS.md, QUICK_WINS.md, ui improvement plan.md (internal planning documents)
- Docs/ directory (to prevent committing draft documentation that should remain 
  local)
- run_app.bat (platform-specific script that may contain local paths)
- Maintained existing exclusions for Python cache, virtual environments, IDE 
  files, and model artifacts

PROJECT ALIGNMENT DOCUMENTATION (alignment.md):

Created comprehensive 370-line analysis document evaluating project compliance 
with FDM Mini Project requirements:

Section 1 - Problem Definition Analysis (20% weight):
- Evaluated business goals identification and clarity of stakeholder definition
- Assessed model selection justification against marking rubric requirements
- Identified gaps in alternative solution discussions and model comparison 
  documentation
- Provided alignment score of 65-70% with specific improvement recommendations

Section 2 - Data Preprocessing Analysis (20% weight):
- Reviewed data cleaning techniques (duplicate removal, outlier handling, text 
  normalization)
- Analyzed missing value handling strategies and imputation approaches
- Evaluated feature engineering implementations (BMI calculation, symptom 
  encoding)
- Documented preprocessing pipeline architecture using sklearn ColumnTransformer
- Identified missing techniques (feature selection, class imbalance handling, 
  encoding strategy comparison)
- Assigned alignment score of 70-75% with recommendations for statistical 
  documentation

Section 3 - Model Building and Evaluation Analysis (20% weight):
- Assessed model selection process (Random Forest, HistGradientBoosting)
- Evaluated evaluation metrics implementation (accuracy, classification report)
- Identified critical gaps: no hyperparameter tuning, limited cross-validation, 
  missing visualizations
- Documented absence of confusion matrices, ROC curves, feature importance 
  analysis
- Provided alignment score of 60-65% with focus on need for GridSearchCV 
  implementation

Section 4 - Deployment Analysis (20% weight):
- Evaluated Streamlit UI functionality and user experience design
- Assessed input validation, BMI calculation, and user feedback mechanisms
- Identified critical gap: no cloud deployment despite being stated requirement
- Documented missing backend API layer and scalability concerns
- Provided alignment score of 65-70% emphasizing deployment as highest priority 
  action

Section 5 - Documentation Analysis (20% weight):
- Reviewed SOW document completeness and README structure
- Assessed code commenting practices and architectural documentation (AGENTS.md)
- Identified incomplete README sections and missing docstrings
- Recommended additions: EDA notebooks, troubleshooting guide, dataset 
  statistics
- Assigned alignment score of 70-75% with focus on technical documentation 
  enhancement

Summary and Actionable Recommendations:
- Calculated overall codebase alignment score of 66-71%
- Created prioritized action list with 20 specific improvement items
- Categorized recommendations by priority: High (deployment, tuning), Medium 
  (EDA, alternative models), Low (API layer, SHAP)
- Provided submission checklist mapping all required deliverables to current 
  status
- Documented dataset requirement verification needs (10,000+ rows, recency)
- Separated codebase improvements from external deliverables (final report, 
  video presentation)

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS AND ARCHITECTURE:

Code Quality Enhancements:
- Maintained adherence to project conventions (no type hints, snake_case naming, 
  4-space indentation)
- Preserved existing import organization patterns (standard library, then 
  third-party)
- Followed established error handling patterns with try-except blocks
- Kept consistent use of joblib for model serialization

User Experience Design Principles:
- Applied medical color scheme (blues, gradients) appropriate for healthcare 
  application context
- Implemented progressive disclosure pattern with expanders for optional fields
- Used visual hierarchy through typography, color, and spacing to guide user 
  attention
- Provided immediate feedback for all user actions (BMI calculation, prediction 
  results)

Data Flow and Processing:
- Maintained clean separation between UI layer (app.py) and model serving
- Preserved proper dataframe construction for model input compatibility
- Kept consistent handling of special symptoms with NaN for missing values
- Maintained label encoder inverse transformation for prediction display

RATIONALE AND IMPACT:

The UI enhancements significantly improve user engagement and make the 
application production-ready from a visual standpoint. The modern, gradient-based 
design with proper spacing and colors creates a professional medical application 
appearance that builds user trust.

The alignment.md document serves multiple critical purposes:
1. Self-assessment tool for identifying project gaps before final submission
2. Roadmap for improvements needed to achieve 75-90% alignment with rubric
3. Documentation of project strengths to highlight in final report
4. Risk mitigation by explicitly calling out missing requirements (cloud 
   deployment)

The .gitignore additions prevent pollution of version control with temporary 
analysis files and local documentation, maintaining repository cleanliness for 
final submission.

TESTING AND VALIDATION:

All UI changes preserve existing functionality while enhancing visual 
presentation. The BMI calculation logic remains unchanged, prediction flow is 
intact, and all input validations continue to function as designed. Custom CSS 
is encapsulated within markdown strings and does not affect Streamlit's core 
functionality.

FUTURE WORK ENABLED:

This commit establishes the foundation for:
- Cloud deployment readiness with professional UI suitable for public access
- Documentation framework for final report writing using alignment analysis
- Visual design patterns that can be extended to additional pages or features
- Self-assessment methodology applicable to future project iterations

DEPENDENCIES AND COMPATIBILITY:

No new dependencies introduced. All enhancements use existing Streamlit 
capabilities (markdown, columns, expander, progress, balloons, bar_chart). 
Compatible with current requirements.txt specification and Python version 
constraints.
